# LOAN APPROVAL ANALYSIS
Loan Approval Analysis

Abstract
Banks earn significant revenue through loans, but defaults increase Non-Performing Assets (NPA). Predicting loan eligibility accurately is crucial for minimizing risk and maximizing profit. This study uses a logistic regression model on a Kaggle dataset to predict loan defaulters and assist banks in making informed decisions.

Introduction
A machine learning-based loan approval system predicts whether a loan application should be approved based on features like income, marital status, loan amount, and duration. This automated system reduces manual effort and ensures fair, priority-based decisions.

Problem Statement
Dream Housing Finance seeks to automate the loan eligibility process for faster and more accurate decisions. By identifying eligible customers, the company minimizes defaults and improves profitability.
